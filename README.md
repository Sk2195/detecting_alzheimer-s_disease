## Overview and Goal of this Project:
- The goal of this project is to create a deep learning machine model using CNN that can correctly categorize Alzheimer's disease stages. Alzheimer's disease is a type of brain disorder that can gradually impair thinking and memory abilities as well as capacity to even perform basic task. The symptoms appear late-onset appear typically in patients in their mid-60s.It's considered rare to strike between the ages of 30 and 60. For older folks, Alzheimer disease can also cause dementia.Following are the stages of the disease: Preclinical stage, mild, moderate, and severe late stage.
